            Terms & Conditions for Websites Because a Terms and Conditions
            agreement is the agreement where you inform the users of your
            website about the rules, terms and guidelines that they need to
            follow in order to use and access your website, a Terms and
            Conditions agreement has become extremely important. While it's not
            required by any laws currently (but third-parties such as Facebook
            may require it), through a Terms and Conditions you can maintain
            your rights to exclude certain users that may abuse your website or
            do not follow the rules you set. It doesn't really matter what kind
            of platform your website uses: WordPress Joomla, Drupal Wix Weebly
            And so on If you don't have this agreement for your website yet, use
            the Generator to create it!
